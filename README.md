# <img src="https://brands.home-assistant.io/sun2/icon.png" alt="Sun2 Sensor" width="50" height="50"/> Sun2 Sensor

Creates sensors that provide information about various sun related events.

Follow the installation instructions below.
Then add one or more locations with desired sensors either via YAML, the UI or both.

## Installation

<details>
<summary>With HACS</summary>

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg)](https://hacs.xyz/)

You can use HACS to manage the installation and provide update notifications.

1. Add this repo as a [custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/).
   It should then appear as a new integration. Click on it. If necessary, search for "sun2".

   ```text
   https://github.com/pnbruckner/ha-sun2
   ```
   Or use this button:
   
   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=pnbruckner&repository=ha-sun2&category=integration)


1. Download the integration using the appropriate button.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Manual</summary>

Place a copy of the files from [`custom_components/sun2`](custom_components/sun2)
in `<config>/custom_components/sun2`,
where `<config>` is your Home Assistant configuration directory.

>__NOTE__: When downloading, make sure to use the `Raw` button from each file's page.

</details>

After it has been downloaded you will need to restart Home Assistant.

### Versions

This custom integration supports HomeAssistant versions 2023.4.0 or newer.

## Services

### `sun2.reload`

Reloads Sun2 from the YAML-configuration. Also adds `SUN2` to the Developers Tools -> YAML page.

### `sun2.get_location`

Responds with the current location configuration options (latitude, etc.) of the specified location.
Takes just one parameter, `location`, which is the name of the location, and is also the name of the corresponding integration entry.

### `sun2.update_location`

Updates one or more parts of the location configuration options of the specified location.
Takes one required parameter, `location`. (Same as `sun2.get_location` service.)
Can also take location parameters (`latitude`, `longitude` & `time_zone`), which if any are specified, they must all be specified.
Can also take observer elevation parameters (`obeserver_elevation`).
These parameters are the same as specified below in the YAML configuration section.

## Configuration

One or more "locations" can be added for this integration.
Each location is defined by a set of parameters (latitude, etc.)
Sensors will be created for each location that provide sun related data for that location.
A location can be added either via the UI or YAML.

To add a location via the UI, you can use this My Button:

[![add integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=sun2)

Alternatively, go to Settings -> Devices & services and click the **`+ ADD INTEGRATION`** button.
Find or search for "sun2", click on it, then follow the prompts.

The remainder of this section defines the list of YAML configuration options for each location.

Key | Optional | Description
-|-|-
`unique_id` | no | Unique identifier for location. This allows any of the remaining options to be changed without looking like a new location.
`location` | yes* | Name of location
`latitude` | yes* | The location's latitude (in degrees)
`longitude` | yes* | The location's longitude (in degrees)
`time_zone` | yes* | The location's time zone. (See the "TZ database name" column at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones.)
`observer_elevation` | yes | What affects sunrise & sunset as defined [here](#observer-elevation)
`binary_sensors` | yes | Binary sensor configurations as defined [here](#binary-sensor-configurations)
`sensors` | yes | Sensor configurations as defined [here](#sensor-configurations)

\* These must all be used together. If not used, the default is Home Assistant's location, time zone & name configuration.

### Observer Elevation

The easterly sun events (sunrise, dawn, etc.) and westerly sun events (sunset, dusk, etc.)
can be viewed at either the horizon, or at the top of some obstruction, such as a mountain.
(For more details, see [Effect of Elevation](https://sffjunkie.github.io/astral/#effect-of-elevation).)
This configuration option describes which apply at the specified location.

There are two basic choices. The first is that the sun events are seen at the horizon in both directions.
In this case, a simple number may be given which defines the observer's elevation above _ground_ level (not sea level) in meters.
If this option is not specified, a default of zero is used.

The second choice is specifying an obstruction in one or both directions (`sunrise_obstruction` and/or `sunset_obstruction`).
For each used, the horizontal distance to the obstruction (`distance`),
and the height of the top of the obstruction, relative to the observer (`relative_height`), must be specified.
Note that the relative height can be negative (e.g., the observer is on an even taller mountain.)
If only one is used, then the observer's elevation above ground level (`above_ground`) must also be specified (for the other direction.)

Here are some examples:

```yaml
observer_elevation: 5

observer_elevation:
  sunrise_obstruction: {distance: 10000, relative_height: 2000}
  sunset_obstruction: {distance: 5000, relative_height: -100}

observer_elevation:
  above_ground: 0
  sunrise_obstruction: {distance: 10000, relative_height: 2000}
```

> Note that this replaces the `elevation` option used in previous versions.

### Binary Sensor Configurations

A list of one or more of the following.

#### `elevation`

`'on'` when sun's elevation is above threshold, `'off'` when at or below threshold.

Key | Optional | Description
-|-|-
`unique_id` | no | Unique identifier for entity. Must be unique within set of binary sensors for location. This allows any of the remaining options to be changed without looking like a new entity.
`elevation` | no | Elevation threshold (in degrees) or `horizon`
`name` | yes | Entity friendly name

For example, this:

```yaml
- unique_id: bs1
  elevation: horizon
```

Would be equivalent to:

```yaml
- unique_id: bs1
  elevation: -0.833
  name: Above horizon
```

### Sensor Configurations

A list of one or more of the following.

#### Time at Elevation Sensor

Key | Optional | Description
-|-|-
`unique_id` | no | Unique identifier for entity. Must be unique within set of sensors for location. This allows any of the remaining options to be changed without looking like a new entity.
`time_at_elevation` | no | Elevation (in degrees)
`direction` | yes | `rising` (default) or `setting`
`icon` | yes | Default is `mdi:weather-sunny`
`name` | yes | Entity friendly name

For example, this:

```yaml
- unique_id: s1
  time_at_elevation: -0.833
```

Would be equivalent to:

```yaml
- unique_id: s1
  time_at_elevation: -0.833
  direction: rising
  icon: mdi:weather-sunny
  name: Rising at minus 0.833 Â°
```

#### Elevation at Time Sensor

Key | Optional | Description
-|-|-
`unique_id` | no | Unique identifier for entity. Must be unique within set of sensors for location. This allows any of the remaining options to be changed without looking like a new entity.
`elevation_at_time` | no | Time string or `input_datetime` entity ID
`name` | yes | Entity friendly name

When using an `input_datetime` entity it must have the time component. The date component is optional.
If the date is not present, the result will be the sun's elevation at the given time on the current date.
If the date is present, it will be used and the result will be the sun's elevation at the given time on the given date.
Also in this case, the `sensor` entity will not have `yesterday`, `today` and `tomorrow` attributes.

## Aditional Sensors

Besides the sensors described above, the following will also be created automatically. Simply enable or disable these entities as desired.

### Point in Time Sensors

Some of these will be enabled by default. The rest will be disabled by default.

Nautical Dawn | no | The time in the morning when the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon
Dawn | yes | The time in the morning when the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon
Rising | yes | AKA Sunrise. The time in the morning when the sun is 0.833 degrees below the horizon. This is to account for refraction.

Some will be enabled by default, but most will not.
Simply go to the Settings -> Devices & services page, click on Sun2, then entities, and enable/disable the entities as desired.
